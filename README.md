# Jira-Database-Analysis
The Jira Database Analysis project involves extracting data from the Jira database using PostgreSQL to build a comprehensive dataset. This dataset contains valuable project management information stored in Jira, such as project status, task completion rates, and other key metrics. The extracted data is then utilized to design and develop data visualizations in both Qlik and Power BI, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights into the project management data.
